Absolutely ‚Äî here‚Äôs a fully rewritten, production-compatible version of branch_agent.md, aligned precisely with your current working system:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Works with your present scripts (encrypt_full_pack.py, encrypt_maths_pack.py, unseal_check.py)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Matches seedUnsealer.js and KeyRoom.js validation logic
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Describes the actual encryption and seeding flow now (no experimental multi-key manifests)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Future-proofed so you can later expand to multi-file seeding without rewriting everything

üß≠ Jemima‚Äôs Asking ‚Äî Branch Agent Specification (2025 Update)

Version

branch_agent.md ‚Äî compatible build for jemima-pack-1 and jemima-maths-1 encryption pipeline.
Status: ‚úÖ stable with KeyRoom.js and seedUnsealer.js.

‚∏ª

üéØ Purpose

The Branch Agent is a self-contained toolkit for producing sealed question and maths packs for Jemima‚Äôs Asking.
It defines exactly how to:
	1.	Assemble a valid plaintext JSON pack (questions or maths).
	2.	Encrypt it using AES-GCM with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256.
	3.	Verify and unseal it for audit or seeding.

All packs generated under this branch are directly loadable by KeyRoom without any schema edits.

‚∏ª

üì¶ File Overview

File	Purpose
encrypt_full_pack.py	Encrypts a 30-question full pack (5 rounds √ó 6 questions) into <ROOM>.sealed.
encrypt_maths_pack.py	Encrypts a maths-only 2-question story pack into <ROOM>-maths.sealed (optional).
unseal_check.py	Decrypts any .sealed file (using the demo passphrase) and prints a non-spoiler audit summary.
sample_full_plaintext.json	Example of a valid jemima-pack-1 plaintext (contains rounds + maths).
sample_maths_plaintext.json	Example of a valid jemima-maths-1 plaintext (standalone maths).


‚∏ª

üîí Encryption Standard

Parameter	Value
Cipher	AES-256-GCM
Key derivation	PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
Iterations	150 000
Salt	16 bytes (random per file)
Nonce / IV	12 bytes (random per file)
Passphrase	"DEMO-ONLY" (test key ‚Äî change only with matching seeder update)
Integrity	SHA-256 checksum of canonical JSON (excluding integrity field)


‚∏ª

üìÅ Envelope Schema (.sealed)

Each sealed file is a JSON envelope with exactly these keys:

{
  "alg": "AES-GCM",
  "pbkdf2": "PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256/150000",
  "salt_b64": "<base64 16 bytes>",
  "nonce_b64": "<base64 12 bytes>",
  "ct_b64": "<base64 ciphertext+tag>"
}

No plaintext data is visible; all content, including questions, is inside ct_b64.

üß© Pack Requirements

üéì Full Pack ‚Äî jemima-pack-1

Minimum viable structure before encryption:

{
  "version": "jemima-pack-1",
  "meta": {
    "roomCode": "ABC",
    "generatedAt": "2025-10-17T00:00:00Z",
    "hostUid": "demo-host",
    "guestUid": "demo-guest"
  },
  "rounds": [ { "round": 1, "hostItems": [...3], "guestItems": [...3] }, ... ],
  "maths": {
    "location": "Market",
    "beats": [ "Line 1", "Line 2", "Line 3", "Line 4" ],
    "questions": [ "Question 1 ___", "Question 2 ___" ],
    "answers": [12, 300]
  }
}

Key facts:
	‚Ä¢	Must contain 5 rounds √ó (3 host + 3 guest) = 30 total questions.
	‚Ä¢	Each item object requires:
	‚Ä¢	subject, difficulty_tier, length_class, question, correct_answer, distractors, provenance_hint.
	‚Ä¢	Must include a valid maths object (even if the maths round is simple).

üßÆ Maths Pack ‚Äî jemima-maths-1

Used when maths is stored separately (for multi-file flow).

{
  "version": "jemima-maths-1",
  "meta": {
    "roomCode": "ABC",
    "generatedAt": "2025-10-17T00:00:00Z",
    "hostUid": "demo-host",
    "guestUid": "demo-guest"
  },
  "maths": {
    "location": "Bakery",
    "beats": [
      "Jemima buys muffins for ¬£2.",
      "Adds tea for ¬£3.",
      "Tips ¬£1.",
      "Walks 200 m home."
    ],
    "questions": [
      "Total spent? ___ pounds",
      "Distance walked? ___ metres"
    ],
    "answers": [6, 200]
  }
}

Both version and meta.roomCode must align with the main pack.

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare plaintext

Edit or generate your JSON packs using your qcfg-natural-2.json configuration.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Encrypt

Full pack:

python3 encrypt_full_pack.py my_full_plaintext.json
# ‚Üí ABC.sealed

Maths pack (optional):

python3 encrypt_maths_pack.py my_maths_plaintext.json
# ‚Üí ABC-maths.sealed

3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify (optional)

python3 unseal_check.py ABC.sealed

Output example:

{
  "version": "jemima-pack-1",
  "meta": { "roomCode": "ABC", "generatedAt": "2025-10-17T00:00:00Z" },
  "rounds_count": 5,
  "items_total": 30,
  "checksum_ok": true
}

4Ô∏è‚É£ Upload in KeyRoom

Drag the .sealed file into the KeyRoom interface.
If maths is included internally, KeyRoom proceeds directly to seeding.
If you adopt a future multi-file format, KeyRoom will later support:

ABC.sealed
ABC-maths.sealed
ABC-meta.json

‚Ä¶but this is not yet required.

‚∏ª

üß± Validation Logic Reference (from seedUnsealer.js)

Check	Requirement
version	must equal "jemima-pack-1" or "jemima-maths-1"
meta.roomCode	3 uppercase alphanumeric characters
meta.hostUid, meta.guestUid	identical between packs
rounds	array of 5; each round has exactly 3 hostItems and 3 guestItems
maths	required for jemima-pack-1; optional for jemima-maths-1
answers	integers only
integrity.checksum	matches recomputed checksum


‚∏ª

üîë Integrity Notes
	‚Ä¢	The integrity checksum ensures that even if the ciphertext is re-encoded, the decrypted payload will fail validation unless unmodified.
	‚Ä¢	Always keep integrity.verified: true as the final flag in plaintexts before encryption.
	‚Ä¢	Never reuse example question text from demonstration files.
Future generation pipelines must produce fresh question text for every sealed pack.
