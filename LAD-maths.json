      "I began rehearsal scribbling the very first rung of the ladder—£100—as my base score.",
      "Next I tossed in the two rungs after it, worth £200 and £300, to keep the warm-up lively.",
      "Because Daniel and Jaime both need practice, I doubled the running tally for our two-player duel.",
      "I couldn't resist adding the £1,000 safe-haven cheque for extra sparkle.",
      "Finally, I pared back the number by carving the two-digit '32' from the £32,000 milestone—as a tidy reminder to stay calm."
